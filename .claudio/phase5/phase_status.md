## Success Criteria Progress
- [ ] All performance benchmarks met (startup time, memory usage, binary size)
- [ ] Security audit passes with no critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Complete documentation enables user self-service
- [ ] Production monitoring provides visibility into CLI usage and issues
- [ ] Binary distribution works across all supported platforms

## Resource Allocation
- **Full Development Team**: All previous team members
- **Technical Writer**: 1 (100% allocation)
- **Security Specialist**: 1 (50% allocation for audit)
- **Total Effort**: 12+ person-weeks (intensive final preparation)

## Dependencies
**From Previous Phase**: 
- Phase 4 (Operations & Deployment) must be complete
- All operational features functional and tested
- Security controls validated and operational
- Performance baseline established

**Project Completion**: 
- Production-ready Rig CLI tool
- Complete documentation and user guides
- Binary distribution and package management
- Production monitoring and support processes

## Production Readiness Checklist
- [ ] All functional requirements implemented and tested
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met or exceeded
- [ ] Security audit completed with no critical issues
- [ ] Documentation complete and validated with users
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility verified
- [ ] Production monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Binary distribution and package management ready
- [ ] Support processes and escalation procedures defined

## Performance Targets
- **Memory Usage**: <50MB normal operation
- **Startup Time**: <500ms for responsive experience
- **Binary Size**: <20MB for efficient distribution
- **CPU Usage**: Minimal system impact

## Final Validation
