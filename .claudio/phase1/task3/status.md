- **Memory**: Clear sensitive data from memory immediately after use
- **Logging**: Filter all sensitive data from logs and error messages

### Network Security Requirements
- **TLS**: Enforce TLS 1.2+ for all communications
- **Certificate Validation**: Proper SSL certificate validation
- **Timeouts**: Appropriate connection and request timeouts
- **Headers**: Secure authentication header implementation

## Platform Support Matrix

### Target Platforms
- **macOS**: Keychain Services API integration
- **Linux**: libsecret/Secret Service API integration  
- **Windows**: Windows Credential Manager integration
- **Fallback**: Encrypted file storage with security warnings

### Testing Requirements
- Cross-platform credential storage validation
- Permission handling for keychain access
- Fallback behavior verification
- Migration testing between storage methods

## Current Activities
**Preparation Phase**:
- Reviewing Max API authentication documentation
- Researching cross-platform credential storage best practices
- Planning HTTP client architecture and retry strategies
- Security requirement analysis and compliance planning

## Deliverables Status

### HTTP Client Components
- [ ] Base HTTP client with reqwest configuration
- [ ] Retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling and types
- [ ] Request/response middleware for authentication

### Authentication System
- [ ] Login command implementation
- [ ] Logout command with credential cleanup
- [ ] Authentication status command
- [ ] Token refresh and validation mechanisms

### Credential Storage
- [ ] Cross-platform keychain integration
- [ ] Secure credential storage and retrieval
- [ ] Migration handling for format updates
- [ ] Fallback mechanisms for unsupported platforms

### Integration Components
- [ ] CLI command integration
- [ ] Authentication context management
- [ ] Error handling integration
- [ ] Configuration system integration

## Performance Targets
- **Login Time**: <3 seconds (successful authentication)
- **Token Refresh**: <500ms (automatic refresh)
- **Credential Retrieval**: <100ms (from secure storage)
- **HTTP Request Overhead**: <50ms (authenticated requests)

## Quality Metrics
**Security Targets**:
- Zero credential exposure in logs/errors
- 100% platform keychain integration success rate
- TLS 1.2+ enforcement for all communications
- Audit compliance for credential handling

**Code Quality Targets**:
- Zero clippy warnings
- 90%+ test coverage for authentication components
- Comprehensive error handling for all failure modes
- Complete security audit validation

## Risk Assessment
**Security Risks**: Medium (high-value authentication implementation)

**Monitored Areas**:
- Cross-platform keychain integration complexity
- Max API authentication protocol changes
- Token security and lifecycle management
- Network security and TLS configuration

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Early platform testing and validation
- Comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Security review and audit compliance
- Performance testing under various network conditions

## Issues and Blockers
**Current Issues**: None

**Potential Blockers**:
- Task 1.2 completion delays affecting CLI integration
- Max API documentation completeness or accessibility
- Platform-specific keychain integration challenges
- Security audit requirements and compliance validation

## Resource Requirements
- **Rust Developer**: 100% allocation for Week 3
- **Security Review**: Security specialist consultation for validation
- **Testing Platforms**: Access to macOS, Linux, Windows for validation
- **API Access**: Max platform testing environment and documentation

## Communication Plan
- **Daily Updates**: Progress on authentication components and security
- **Mid-Week Security Review**: Credential storage and network security validation
- **Week End**: Complete authentication system validation and security audit

## Success Criteria
**Technical Validation**:
- `rig login` successfully authenticates with Max platform
- Credentials stored securely across all supported platforms
- Token refresh works automatically without user intervention
- Authentication state persists correctly across CLI sessions

**Security Validation**:
- Security audit passes with no critical vulnerabilities
- Credential handling meets OWASP guidelines
- Network communications properly secured with TLS
- Audit trail complete for authentication events

**Integration Validation**:
- Authentication integrates seamlessly with CLI framework
- Error handling provides clear, actionable guidance
- Performance meets CLI responsiveness requirements
- Configuration system can override authentication settings

## Compliance Requirements
- **OWASP Guidelines**: Credential storage and handling compliance
- **Data Protection**: Compliance with relevant data protection regulations
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail for authentication events
- **Documentation**: Security measures documentation for audit purposes

## Next Actions
1. **Upon Task 1.2 Completion**: Begin HTTP client and authentication architecture
2. **Day 1**: Implement HTTP client wrapper with retry logic
3. **Day 2**: Build authentication commands and Max API integration
4. **Day 3**: Implement cross-platform credential storage
5. **Day 4**: Complete token management and context integration
6. **Day 5**: Security validation and comprehensive testing

## Notes
Authentication is the security foundation for the entire Rig CLI tool. This implementation must be robust, secure, and maintainable. Pay special attention to:

1. **Security First**: Every design decision should prioritize security
2. **Cross-Platform Reliability**: Ensure consistent behavior across all platforms
3. **User Experience**: Make authentication seamless and intuitive
4. **Audit Compliance**: Maintain complete audit trail and documentation

The authentication system will be used by all subsequent phases, so focus on creating a reliable, secure foundation that can handle the full scope of Max platform operations.
