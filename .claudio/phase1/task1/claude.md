- **Timeline**: Week 1 of Phase 1

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Cargo workspace configured with proper dependency management and modular structure
- [ ] Development dependencies configured (clap 4.x, reqwest 0.11, serde 1.x, tokio 1.x, anyhow 1.x, tracing 0.1)
- [ ] Development environment setup completed (rustfmt, clippy, IDE configuration)
- [ ] Project structure follows discovery recommendations with clear module separation
- [ ] Logging framework implemented using tracing crate with proper configuration
- [ ] All team members can successfully build and run the project

## Technical Specifications

**Rust Configuration**:
- **Edition**: Rust 2021
- **MSRV**: 1.70+ (latest stable recommended)
- **Features**: Use workspace inheritance for common dependencies

**Workspace Structure**:
```

├── Cargo.toml (workspace root)
├── cli/
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── src/
│       └── main.rs
├── core/
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── src/
│       ├── lib.rs
│       ├── auth/

├── utils/
│   ├── Cargo.toml

│       └── lib.rs
└── tests/
    └── integration/
```

**Required Dependencies**:
- **CLI Framework**: clap = "4.4" (with derive feature)
- **HTTP Client**: reqwest = "0.11" (with json and native-tls features)
- **Serialization**: serde = "1.0" (with derive feature)
- **Async Runtime**: tokio = "1.0" (with full feature)
- **Error Handling**: anyhow = "1.0"
- **Logging**: tracing = "0.1", tracing-subscriber = "0.3"
- **Configuration**: config = "0.14"
- **Security**: keyring = "2.0" (for credential storage)

**Development Dependencies**:
- **Testing**: mockall = "0.11", tempfile = "3.8"
- **Benchmarking**: criterion = "0.5"

## Implementation Guidelines

**Workspace Configuration**:
1. Create root `Cargo.toml` with workspace definition
2. Set up shared dependency versions in workspace
3. Configure workspace-level metadata and authors
4. Establish consistent edition and MSRV across crates

**Module Organization**:
1. **cli crate**: Main binary with command-line interface
2. **core crate**: Business logic, authentication, HTTP client
3. **utils crate**: Shared utilities and helper functions
4. Separate integration tests directory

**Development Tooling**:
1. Configure rustfmt with project-specific settings
2. Set up clippy with strict linting configuration
3. Create `.editorconfig` for IDE consistency
4. Establish git hooks for pre-commit quality checks

**Logging Infrastructure**:
1. Initialize tracing subscriber with appropriate formatting
2. Configure log levels for different build profiles
3. Set up structured logging for JSON output mode
4. Implement log filtering and performance optimization

## Quality Requirements

**Code Standards**:
- Zero clippy warnings with strict configuration
- Consistent formatting using rustfmt
- Comprehensive documentation for public APIs
- Clear module boundaries and separation of concerns

**Security Standards**:
- No unsafe code without explicit justification
- Dependency security auditing setup
- Proper error handling without information leakage
- Secure defaults for all configurations

**Performance Standards**:
- Fast compilation times through proper dependency management
- Minimal startup overhead for CLI responsiveness
- Memory-efficient logging configuration
- Optimized build profiles for development and release

## Testing Requirements

**Unit Testing Setup**:
- Configure cargo test for all workspace crates
- Set up test utilities and shared test infrastructure
- Implement property-based testing where appropriate
- Establish test coverage measurement and reporting

**Integration Testing Framework**:
- Create integration test structure in tests/ directory
- Set up test fixtures and data management
- Configure test environment isolation
- Implement CLI testing utilities

**CI/CD Foundation**:
- Prepare workspace for automated testing
- Configure build matrix for cross-platform validation
- Set up caching strategies for dependency builds
- Establish quality gates and failure criteria

## Deliverables

**Configuration Files**:
- Root `Cargo.toml` with complete workspace definition
- Individual crate `Cargo.toml` files with proper dependencies
- `.rustfmt.toml` with project formatting standards
- `clippy.toml` with linting configuration

**Project Structure**:
- Complete directory hierarchy with placeholder modules
- Module interface definitions and documentation
- Basic library and binary structure
- Integration test framework setup

**Development Environment**:
- IDE configuration files (.vscode/, .idea/)
- Git configuration (.gitignore, hooks)
- Development scripts and utilities
- Team onboarding documentation

**Logging System**:
- Tracing subscriber configuration
- Log level management
- Structured logging format definition
- Performance-optimized logging setup

## Context Integration
- **Phase Context**: Reference `../claude.md` for phase coordination and overall objectives
- **Project Context**: Use `/Users/vinnie/github/rig/.claudio/plan.md` for architectural guidance
- **Next Task**: Prepare foundation for Task 1.2 (CLI Framework Foundation)

## Success Validation

**Immediate Validation**:
- `cargo build` succeeds for all workspace crates
- `cargo test` runs without errors (even with placeholder tests)
- `cargo clippy` produces zero warnings
- `cargo fmt --check` passes without changes needed

**Team Validation**:
- All team members can clone, build, and run the project
- Development environment setup documentation is clear and complete
- Logging system produces appropriate output for different verbosity levels
- Project structure aligns with architectural requirements

**Integration Readiness**:
- Workspace prepared for CLI framework integration
- Module interfaces defined for authentication and HTTP components
- Testing infrastructure ready for comprehensive test suite
- CI/CD foundation prepared for automated validation

## Next Steps After Completion
1. Update task status in `status.md` with completion details
2. Validate project setup with all team members
3. Coordinate with Task 1.2 assignee for CLI framework implementation
4. Document any deviations from plan or additional setup requirements

This task establishes the critical foundation that enables all subsequent development work. Focus on creating a robust, maintainable workspace that will scale throughout the project lifecycle.
