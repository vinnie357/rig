# Task 1.2 Status: CLI Framework Foundation

## Task Information
- **Task ID**: 1.2
- **Task Name**: CLI Framework Foundation
- **Phase**: 1 - Foundation
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: 1 week
- **Assignee**: Rust Developer
- **Status**: Not Started

## Progress Summary
- **Start Date**: TBD (Week 2)
- **Target Completion**: End of Week 2
- **Current Status**: Waiting for Task 1.1 completion
- **Completion**: 0%

## Dependencies
**Prerequisites**: 
- Task 1.1: Project Infrastructure Setup (Must be complete)
- Cargo workspace and development environment ready
- Basic project structure and dependencies configured

**Blocks**: 
- Task 1.3: Authentication Implementation
- All subsequent CLI command implementations

## Acceptance Criteria Progress
- [ ] Base CLI structure implemented using clap with extensible command architecture
- [ ] Command registry and routing system supports modular command addition without modification
- [ ] Help system provides comprehensive command documentation with examples and usage patterns
- [ ] Global flags implemented and functional (--json, --verbose, --config)
- [ ] Error handling system provides clear, actionable user feedback with appropriate exit codes
- [ ] Command structure supports future command additions through plugin architecture

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Week 2 Schedule
**Day 1-2**: CLI Architecture Design
- Command trait definition and registry design
- Clap configuration structure
- Global flag architecture planning

**Day 3-4**: Core Implementation
- Base CLI structure with clap
- Command registry and routing system
- Global flag handling implementation

**Day 5**: Help System and Testing
- Comprehensive help system implementation
- Error handling and user feedback
- Unit and integration testing

## Current Activities
**Preparation Phase**:
- Reviewing clap 4.x documentation and best practices
- Planning command structure and extensibility patterns
- Preparing for Task 1.1 handoff

## Deliverables Status

### CLI Framework Components
- [ ] Base clap application structure
- [ ] Command trait and registry system
- [ ] Global flag handling (--json, --verbose, --config)
- [ ] Command routing and execution logic

### Help System
- [ ] Comprehensive command help text
- [ ] Context-sensitive help display
- [ ] Usage examples and patterns
- [ ] Command discovery features

### Error Handling
- [ ] User-friendly error message system
- [ ] Appropriate exit codes
- [ ] Debug information with verbose mode
- [ ] Error recovery suggestions

### Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Unit tests for CLI parsing
- [ ] Integration tests for command execution
- [ ] Help system validation
- [ ] Error handling verification

## Performance Targets
- **CLI Startup Time**: <100ms (target)
- **Help Display**: <50ms (target)
- **Command Parsing**: <10ms (target)
- **Memory Usage**: <10MB framework overhead (target)

## Quality Metrics
**Code Quality Targets**:
- Zero clippy warnings
- 100% rustfmt compliance
- 90%+ test coverage for CLI components
- Comprehensive documentation

**User Experience Targets**:
- Intuitive command discovery
- Clear error messages with guidance
- Consistent output formatting
- Fast help system access

## Integration Planning

### Authentication Integration (Task 1.3)
- CLI context includes authentication state tracking
- Commands check authentication requirements
- Error handling for authentication failures
- Help system adapts to user authentication status

### Configuration Integration (Task 1.4)
- Global config flag integration
- Configuration value precedence handling
- Settings persistence across CLI operations
- User preference management

## Risk Assessment
**Current Risks**: Low (standard CLI implementation)

**Monitored Areas**:
- Clap 4.x learning curve and best practices
- Command extensibility architecture complexity
- Performance requirements for CLI responsiveness
- Help system usability and completeness

## Issues and Blockers
**Current Issues**: None

**Potential Blockers**:
- Task 1.1 completion delays
- Clap configuration complexity
- Command architecture design decisions
- Performance optimization requirements

## Resource Requirements
- **Rust Developer**: 100% allocation for Week 2
- **Tools**: clap 4.x, Rust testing frameworks, CLI testing utilities
- **Environment**: Development environment from Task 1.1

## Communication Plan
- **Daily Updates**: Progress on CLI components and architecture
- **Mid-Week Review**: Command structure and help system design
- **Week End**: Complete framework validation and Task 1.3 handoff

## Success Criteria
**Technical Validation**:
- `rig --help` displays comprehensive command overview
- Global flags work consistently across all commands
- Command registry enables easy command addition
- Error handling provides actionable user guidance

**Integration Readiness**:
- CLI framework prepared for authentication integration
- Command interfaces defined for future implementations
- Help system supports dynamic command addition
- Error handling scales with command complexity

## Next Actions
1. **Upon Task 1.1 Completion**: Begin CLI architecture implementation
2. **Day 1-2**: Design and implement command trait and registry
3. **Day 3-4**: Build core CLI structure with global flags
4. **Day 5**: Complete help system and comprehensive testing

## Notes
The CLI framework is the primary user interface for the entire Rig CLI tool. The architecture decisions made here will impact all future development, so focus on creating a flexible, extensible foundation that can grow with the project requirements.

Pay special attention to user experience design - the help system and error handling will be critical for user adoption and productivity. Consider the target user's workflow and optimize for common usage patterns while maintaining comprehensive functionality.
