## Key Milestones
- **Week 1 End**: Project infrastructure and workspace setup complete
- **Week 2 End**: CLI framework with command structure functional
- **Week 3 End**: Authentication system integrated with Max platform
- **Week 4 End**: Complete testing infrastructure and CI/CD pipeline

## Success Criteria Progress
- [ ] `rig login` successfully authenticates users with Max platform
- [ ] Secure credential storage working across macOS, Linux, Windows
- [ ] Basic CLI help system provides comprehensive command guidance
- [ ] Automated testing pipeline validates all changes
- [ ] Project structure supports modular development approach

## Resource Allocation
- **Rust Developers**: 2 (100% allocation)
- **DevOps Engineer**: 1 (75% allocation)
- **Total Effort**: 7 person-weeks

## Risk Assessment
**Current Risk Level**: Low (preparation phase)

**Monitored Risks**:
- Rust learning curve for team members - **Status**: Monitoring
- OS keychain integration complexity - **Status**: Preparation phase
- HTTP client configuration complexity - **Status**: Preparation phase

## Issues and Blockers
**Current Issues**: None

**Potential Blockers**:
- Team availability and resource allocation
- Development environment setup challenges
- Platform-specific integration issues

## Next Steps
1. Finalize team assignments and start dates
2. Begin Task 1.1: Project Infrastructure Setup
3. Establish development environment for all team members
4. Schedule weekly phase review meetings

## Dependencies
**From Previous Phases**: None (foundational phase)

**For Next Phase**: 
- Working authentication system with credential storage
- Stable CLI framework ready for extension
- Comprehensive testing infrastructure
- Configured development environment

## Quality Gates
- [ ] All tasks meet acceptance criteria
- [ ] Code review completion (100%)
- [ ] Cross-platform testing validation
- [ ] Security review for authentication components
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established

## Communication
- **Daily Standups**: TBD
- **Weekly Reviews**: TBD
- **Phase Transition Review**: End of Week 4
- **Stakeholder Updates**: Weekly progress reports

This foundational phase is critical for project success. All subsequent phases depend on the robust infrastructure, authentication system, and development practices established here.
