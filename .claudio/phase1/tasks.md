- [ ] All team members can build and run the project successfully

**Technical Requirements**:
- **Rust Version**: Latest stable (1.70+)
- **Dependencies**: clap 4.x, reqwest 0.11, serde 1.x, tokio 1.x, anyhow 1.x, tracing 0.1
- **Architecture**: Modular workspace with separate crates for core, CLI, and utilities
- **Standards**: Rust 2021 edition, strict clippy configuration

**Deliverables**:
- `Cargo.toml` workspace configuration
- Project directory structure with module organization
- Development tooling configuration files
- Basic logging infrastructure
- Team development setup documentation

### Task 1.2: CLI Framework Foundation
**Priority**: High  
**Effort**: 1 week  
**Type**: Development  
**Lead**: Rust Developer  

**Description**: Implement base CLI structure with clap, command registry, routing system, and comprehensive help system.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Base CLI structure implemented using clap with extensible command architecture
- [ ] Command registry and routing system supports modular command addition
- [ ] Help system provides comprehensive command documentation with examples
- [ ] Global flags implemented (--json, --verbose, --config) and functional
- [ ] Error handling system provides clear, actionable user feedback
- [ ] Command structure supports future command additions without modification

**Technical Requirements**:
- **Framework**: clap 4.x with derive feature
- **Architecture**: Command pattern with trait-based extensibility
- **Output**: Structured output with JSON and text modes
- **Error Handling**: anyhow for error propagation, custom error types for user-facing messages

**Dependencies**: Task 1.1 (Project Infrastructure)

**Deliverables**:

- Global flags implementation
- Error handling and user feedback systems

### Task 1.3: Authentication Implementation
**Priority**: High  
**Effort**: 1 week  
**Type**: Development  
**Lead**: Rust Developer  

**Description**: Build HTTP client wrapper, implement login command with token exchange, and create secure credential storage.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] HTTP client wrapper implemented with retry logic and comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Login command successfully authenticates with Max API and stores tokens securely
- [ ] Secure credential storage using OS keychain integration works on all platforms
- [ ] Authentication context management tracks session state and token validity
- [ ] Token refresh mechanism handles expired tokens automatically
- [ ] Security standards met for credential handling and storage

**Technical Requirements**:
- **HTTP Client**: reqwest with custom retry logic and timeout configuration
- **Security**: OS keychain integration (keyring crate), secure token storage
- **Platforms**: macOS (Keychain), Linux (Secret Service), Windows (Credential Manager)
- **API Integration**: Max platform authentication endpoints

**Dependencies**: Task 1.2 (CLI Framework)

**Deliverables**:
- HTTP client wrapper with error handling
- Login command implementation
- Secure credential storage system
- Authentication context management
- Token refresh and validation logic

### Task 1.4: Configuration and Testing Infrastructure
**Priority**: High  
**Effort**: 1 week  
**Type**: Development/Testing  
**Lead**: Rust Developer + DevOps Engineer  

**Description**: Implement configuration file management, build comprehensive test framework, and set up CI/CD pipeline.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Configuration file management supports user preferences and settings persistence
- [ ] Comprehensive unit test framework achieves 90%+ code coverage
- [ ] Integration test harness supports end-to-end command testing
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline validates all changes with automated testing
- [ ] Test suite runs reliably across all supported platforms
- [ ] Quality gates prevent regression and maintain code standards

**Technical Requirements**:
- **Configuration**: TOML/YAML configuration files with validation
- **Testing**: cargo test, mockall for mocking, tempfile for isolated testing
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with cross-platform testing matrix
- **Quality**: clippy, rustfmt, and security auditing in pipeline

**Dependencies**: Task 1.3 (Authentication)

**Deliverables**:
- Configuration file management system
- Comprehensive unit and integration test suites
- CI/CD pipeline with automated quality checks
- Cross-platform testing configuration
- Documentation for testing procedures

## Success Criteria

**Phase Completion Requirements**:
- [ ] `rig login` successfully authenticates users with Max platform
- [ ] Secure credential storage working across macOS, Linux, Windows
- [ ] Basic CLI help system provides comprehensive command guidance
- [ ] Automated testing pipeline validates all changes
- [ ] Project structure supports modular development approach
- [ ] All team members productive in development environment
- [ ] Code quality standards enforced through automated tooling

## Risk Mitigation

**High-Risk Items**:
- **Rust Learning Curve**: Pair programming and knowledge sharing sessions
- **OS Keychain Integration**: Early platform testing and fallback strategies
- **HTTP Client Complexity**: Comprehensive error handling and retry logic

**Monitoring**:
