- Development environment configuration (rustfmt, clippy, IDE setup)
- Basic project structure following discovery recommendations
- Logging framework implementation with tracing

**Week 2**: CLI Framework Foundation  
- Base CLI structure using clap with extensible command architecture
- Command registry and routing system for modular development
- Comprehensive help system with command documentation
- Global flags implementation (--json, --verbose, --config)
- Error handling and user feedback systems

**Week 3**: Authentication Implementation
- HTTP client wrapper with retry logic and error handling
- Login command with Max API token exchange
- Secure credential storage using OS keychain integration
- Authentication context management and session tracking
- Token refresh and validation mechanisms

**Week 4**: Configuration and Testing Infrastructure
- Configuration file management and settings persistence
- Comprehensive unit test framework (target: 90% coverage)
- Integration test harness for command workflows
- CI/CD pipeline with automated testing and quality gates
- Cross-platform compatibility validation

## Context Management

**Project Context**: Reference `/Users/vinnie/github/rig/.claudio/plan.md` for complete project scope and phase relationships.

**Architecture Context**: Use project discovery findings to guide technical decisions and ensure alignment with Max platform requirements.

**Next Phase Preparation**: Foundation phase outputs are prerequisites for Phase 2 (Core Communication). Ensure WebSocket preparation work sets up proper abstractions for Phase 2 implementation.

## Technical Standards

**Code Quality Requirements**:
- Rust 2021 edition with latest stable compiler
- Strict clippy configuration with zero warnings
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- 90%+ test coverage for all new code
- Security-first approach for credential handling

**Documentation Standards**:
- Inline code documentation for all public APIs
- Comprehensive README with setup instructions
- Contributing guidelines for team development
- Command documentation with examples

**Security Requirements**:
- Secure credential storage using OS keychain services
- TLS for all network communications
- Input validation and sanitization
- Security audit preparation for sensitive operations

## Success Criteria

**Phase Completion Gates**:
- [ ] `rig login` command successfully authenticates with Max platform
- [ ] Secure credential storage functional across macOS, Linux, Windows
- [ ] CLI help system provides comprehensive guidance for all commands
- [ ] Automated testing pipeline validates changes with zero failures
- [ ] Project structure supports modular development for remaining phases
- [ ] All team members productive in configured development environment

**Quality Validation**:
- All acceptance criteria met for each task
- Code review approval for all implementations
- Cross-platform testing passes on CI/CD pipeline
- Security review completed for authentication components
- Performance benchmarks established for CLI responsiveness

## Risk Management

**High-Risk Areas**:
- **Rust Learning Curve**: Implement pair programming and knowledge sharing
- **OS Keychain Integration**: Early platform testing with fallback strategies
- **HTTP Client Configuration**: Comprehensive error handling and retry logic

**Monitoring Mechanisms**:
- Daily progress tracking through standup meetings
- Weekly cross-platform integration testing
- Continuous CI/CD pipeline health monitoring
- Regular security review of authentication implementation

## Communication Protocols

**Daily Coordination**:
- Morning standup for progress updates and blocker identification
- Continuous integration feedback monitoring
- Peer review process for all code changes

**Weekly Reviews**:
- Phase progress assessment against timeline
- Risk evaluation and mitigation strategy updates
- Cross-functional team coordination (DevOps, development)
- Preparation planning for Phase 2 transition

**Phase Transition**:
- Comprehensive handoff documentation for Phase 2 team
- Authentication system validation and documentation
- CI/CD pipeline transfer and training
- Technical debt assessment and documentation

## Implementation Guidelines

**Development Approach**:
- Start with simplest viable implementation, then iterate
- Prioritize security and reliability over feature completeness
- Maintain comprehensive testing throughout development
- Document architectural decisions and trade-offs

**Team Coordination**:
- Use feature branches with pull request reviews
- Maintain shared development standards and practices
- Regular pairing sessions for knowledge transfer
- Cross-training on critical systems and processes

**Quality Assurance**:
- Automated testing at multiple levels (unit, integration, end-to-end)
- Security review for all authentication-related code
- Performance validation for CLI responsiveness
- Cross-platform compatibility verification

This phase establishes the critical foundation that enables all subsequent development. Focus on building robust, secure, and maintainable systems that will support the full scope of the Rig CLI tool development.
