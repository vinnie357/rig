## Key Milestones
- **Week 9 End**: Network management commands functional with validation
- **Week 10 End**: Application management with network association complete
- **Week 11 End**: Environment variable and secret management operational
- **Week 12 End**: Configuration management and resource details complete

## Success Criteria Progress
- [ ] All resource creation commands functional with proper validation
- [ ] Status commands provide comprehensive and accurate information
- [ ] Environment variable management maintains security for sensitive data
- [ ] Configuration retrieval provides complete resource details
- [ ] Resource operations handle errors gracefully with actionable feedback

## Resource Allocation
- **Developers**: 3 (100% allocation)
- **QA Engineer**: 1 (50% allocation increasing to 75% in Task 3.4)
- **Total Effort**: 12.5 person-weeks

## Dependencies
**From Previous Phase**: 
- Phase 2 (Core Communication) must be complete
- Real-time communication infrastructure functional
- Event processing system operational
- WebSocket and Phoenix channel protocols stable

**For Next Phase**: 
- Complete resource management system
- Security controls validated and operational
- Performance optimized for production workloads
- Resource context ready for deployment integration

## Risk Assessment
**Current Risk Level**: Medium (complex validation and security requirements)

**Monitored Risks**:
- Complex validation rules for naming and resource constraints
- Secure handling of sensitive environment variables
- Performance with large numbers of resources
- Integration complexity with Max platform resource APIs

## Issues and Blockers
**Current Issues**: None

**Potential Blockers**:
- Phase 2 completion delays
- Max platform resource API specification changes
- Security requirements complexity
- Performance optimization challenges

## Quality Gates
- [ ] Resource validation prevents all invalid configurations
- [ ] Security audit passes for sensitive data handling
- [ ] Performance testing validates resource operation speeds
- [ ] Integration testing with Max platform successful
- [ ] User experience testing validates workflow efficiency

## Communication
- **Daily Standups**: Resource implementation progress and validation
- **Weekly Reviews**: Security validation and performance testing
- **Phase Transition Review**: End of Week 12
- **Stakeholder Updates**: Weekly progress with security and performance metrics

## Next Steps
1. Await Phase 2 completion and validation
2. Begin Task 3.1: Network Management implementation
3. Establish resource validation framework
4. Schedule security review sessions for sensitive data handling

This phase implements the core resource management functionality that forms the heart of user interactions with the Rig CLI tool. Focus on security, performance, and user experience to create a robust foundation for deployment and operational features.
