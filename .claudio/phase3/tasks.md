# Phase 3: Resource Management - Task List

**Duration**: 4 weeks  
**Team**: 3 developers, 1 QA engineer  
**Timeline**: Weeks 9-12  

## Overview

Implement all resource management commands (network, app, variables), build comprehensive status and monitoring capabilities, create configuration management and details retrieval, establish data validation and security controls.

## Task Breakdown

### Task 3.1: Network Management
**Priority**: High  
**Effort**: 1 week  
**Type**: Development  

**Description**: Implement network creation and management with RFC1035 validation, uniqueness checking, and comprehensive status reporting.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] `rig create network` with RFC1035 validation functional
- [ ] Network name uniqueness checking prevents conflicts
- [ ] `rig status network` provides comprehensive information
- [ ] Network listing and filtering capabilities implemented
- [ ] Network deletion and management operations secure and reliable

**Deliverables**:
- Network creation commands with validation
- Network status and listing functionality
- Network management operations
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

### Task 3.2: Application Management
**Priority**: High  
**Effort**: 1 week  
**Type**: Development  

**Description**: Implement application lifecycle management with network association, hostname generation, and detailed status reporting.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] `rig create app` with network association functional
- [ ] Application uniqueness validation per network enforced
- [ ] Hostname generation follows app.network.domain.example pattern
- [ ] `rig status app` provides detailed application information
- [ ] Application lifecycle management (update, delete) complete

**Deliverables**:
- Application creation and association logic
- Hostname generation and validation
- Application status and management commands
- Lifecycle management operations

### Task 3.3: Environment Configuration
**Priority**: High  
**Effort**: 1 week  
**Type**: Development  

**Description**: Implement environment variable and secret management with secure handling, bulk operations, and inheritance logic.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] `rig create var` for non-sensitive environment variables
- [ ] `rig create secret` with secure handling for sensitive data
- [ ] Bulk environment variable operations functional
- [ ] Environment variable inheritance and override logic implemented
- [ ] Environment variable listing and deletion capabilities complete

**Deliverables**:
- Environment variable management commands
- Secure secret handling implementation
- Bulk operations and inheritance logic
- Security controls and audit capabilities

### Task 3.4: Configuration and Details
**Priority**: High  
**Effort**: 1 week  
**Type**: Development/Testing  

**Description**: Implement detailed resource information retrieval, configuration management, and comprehensive validation.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] `rig details app` and `rig details network` commands functional
- [ ] Configuration export and import capabilities implemented
- [ ] Configuration drift detection and reporting operational
- [ ] Configuration history and change tracking complete
- [ ] Comprehensive resource validation and error reporting functional

**Deliverables**:
- Resource details and information commands
- Configuration export/import functionality
- Change tracking and drift detection
- Validation and error reporting systems

## Success Criteria

**Phase Completion Requirements**:
- [ ] All resource creation commands functional with proper validation
- [ ] Status commands provide comprehensive and accurate information
- [ ] Environment variable management maintains security for sensitive data
- [ ] Configuration retrieval provides complete resource details
- [ ] Resource operations handle errors gracefully with actionable feedback

## Risk Mitigation

**Medium-Risk Items**:
- Complex validation rules for naming and resource constraints
- Secure handling of sensitive environment variables
- Performance with large numbers of resources

## Handoff Requirements

**For Phase 4**:
- Complete resource management system ready for deployment integration
- Security controls validated and operational
- Performance optimized for production workloads
