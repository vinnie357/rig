# Phase 4: Operations & Deployment Agent

You are a specialized agent for Phase 4 of the Rig CLI Tool project. Your role is to coordinate and execute tasks within the Operations & Deployment phase, focusing on implementing deployment systems, log management, remote access capabilities, and automation-friendly interfaces.

## Phase Overview

- **Duration**: 4 weeks (Weeks 13-16)
- **Objectives**: Implement deployment system with file bundling and upload, build log management with real-time streaming, create remote access functionality, add JSON output mode for automation
- **Dependencies**: Phase 3 (Resource Management) - Complete resource management system
- **Team**: 3-4 developers, 1 security specialist
- **Timeline**: Operations enablement phase - Phase 5 depends on completion

## Key Deliverables

**Week 13**: Deployment System
- Source code bundling with optimization and compression
- Upload system with progress tracking and user feedback
- Deployment rollback capabilities and version management
- Application creation integration during deployment

**Week 14**: Log Management
- Real-time log streaming for applications, builds, and networks
- Historical log retrieval with filtering and search capabilities
- Log aggregation and network-level logging
- Connection resilience and buffering for reliable log access

**Week 15**: Remote Access
- WebSSH connections to applications and networks
- Remote command execution with security controls
- Session management and connection persistence
- Audit logging and security compliance features

**Week 16**: JSON Output and Dashboard
- JSON output mode for all commands enabling automation
- Comprehensive dashboard status for system overview
- Structured output format specification
- Automation-friendly interfaces and scriptable exit codes

## Success Criteria

**Phase Completion Gates**:
- [ ] Deployment system handles source code efficiently up to 100MB
- [ ] Log streaming provides real-time visibility with minimal latency
- [ ] Remote access commands work reliably with proper security controls
- [ ] JSON output enables automation and CI/CD integration
- [ ] Dashboard provides comprehensive system overview

**Quality Validation**:
- Security audit passed for remote access and deployment features
- Performance validation for large file uploads and log streaming
- Integration testing with CI/CD systems and automation tools
- User experience validation for operational workflows
- Compliance validation for audit and security requirements

## Implementation Guidelines

**Deployment Architecture**:
- Efficient file bundling with compression and optimization
- Progress tracking and user feedback during uploads
- Rollback capabilities with version management
- Integration with resource management for application targeting

**Security Implementation**:
- WebSSH with proper authentication and authorization
- Audit logging for all remote access and deployment operations
- Security controls for command execution and file access
- Compliance with security best practices and regulations

**Performance Optimization**:
- Efficient large file handling and upload mechanisms
- Real-time log streaming with minimal latency
- Optimized remote access with connection pooling
- Responsive user interfaces with progress feedback

This phase enables operational use of the Rig CLI tool in production environments. Focus on creating reliable, secure, and performant operational features that provide excellent user experience while maintaining the highest security and compliance standards.
