- Application creation during deployment flow

### Task 4.2: Log Management
**Priority**: High  
**Effort**: 1 week  
**Type**: Development  

**Description**: Implement real-time log streaming with historical access, build aggregation, and network-level logging.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

### Task 4.4: JSON Output and Dashboard
**Priority**: High  
**Effort**: 1 week  
**Type**: Development/Integration  

**Description**: Add JSON output mode for automation, implement comprehensive dashboard status, and create scriptable interfaces.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] JSON output mode (`-o json`) for all commands functional
- [ ] `rig status dashboard` for comprehensive overview implemented
- [ ] Structured output format specification complete
- [ ] Output formatting and pretty-printing capabilities operational
- [ ] Scriptable exit codes and error reporting implemented

**Deliverables**:
- JSON output mode for all commands
- Comprehensive dashboard status view
- Structured output format specification
- Automation-friendly interfaces and exit codes

## Success Criteria

**Phase Completion Requirements**:
- [ ] Deployment system handles source code efficiently up to 100MB
- [ ] Log streaming provides real-time visibility with minimal latency
- [ ] Remote access commands work reliably with proper security controls
- [ ] JSON output enables automation and CI/CD integration
- [ ] Dashboard provides comprehensive system overview

## Risk Mitigation

**High-Risk Items**:
- File upload performance and reliability for large deployments
- WebSSH security and session management complexity
- Real-time log streaming performance and memory usage

## Handoff Requirements

**For Phase 5**:
- Complete operational feature set ready for production
- Security controls validated and audited
- Performance optimized for production scale
