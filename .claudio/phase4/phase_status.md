## Task Details

### Not Started ‚è∏
- **Task 4.1: Deployment System**: Planned start Week 13
  - Priority: High
  - Effort: 1 week
  - Dependencies: Phase 3 completion

- **Task 4.2: Log Management**: Planned start Week 14
  - Priority: High
  - Effort: 1 week
  - Dependencies: Task 4.1

- **Task 4.3: Remote Access**: Planned start Week 15
  - Priority: High
  - Effort: 1 week
  - Dependencies: Task 4.2

- **Task 4.4: JSON Output and Dashboard**: Planned start Week 16
  - Priority: High
  - Effort: 1 week
  - Dependencies: Task 4.3

## Success Criteria Progress
- [ ] Deployment system handles source code efficiently up to 100MB
- [ ] Log streaming provides real-time visibility with minimal latency
- [ ] Remote access commands work reliably with proper security controls
- [ ] JSON output enables automation and CI/CD integration
- [ ] Dashboard provides comprehensive system overview

## Resource Allocation
- **Developers**: 3-4 (100% allocation)
- **Security Specialist**: 1 (75% allocation)
- **Total Effort**: 15.75 person-weeks

## Dependencies
**From Previous Phase**: 
- Phase 3 (Resource Management) must be complete
- Resource management system operational
- Security controls validated
- Performance optimized for production workloads

**For Next Phase**: 
- Complete operational feature set
- Security controls validated and audited
- Performance optimized for production scale
- Automation interfaces ready for CI/CD integration

## Risk Assessment
**Current Risk Level**: High (complex operational features with security requirements)

**High-Risk Areas**:
- File upload performance and reliability for large deployments
- WebSSH security and session management complexity
- Real-time log streaming performance and memory usage

## Next Steps
1. Await Phase 3 completion and validation
2. Begin Task 4.1: Deployment System implementation
3. Establish security review processes for remote access features
4. Schedule performance testing for operational features
