## Notes
This task establishes the foundational WebSocket communication layer that enables all real-time features in the Rig CLI tool. The implementation must be robust, performant, and ready to support the Phoenix channel protocol that will be implemented in Task 2.2.

**Critical Success Factors**:
1. **Performance First**: Meet latency requirements from initial implementation
2. **Reliability**: Handle all common network failure scenarios gracefully  
3. **Integration Ready**: Prepare proper interfaces for Phoenix channel integration
4. **Testing Comprehensive**: Validate all scenarios including edge cases and failures

The WebSocket foundation directly impacts user experience for all real-time features, so focus on creating a high-quality, reliable implementation that will scale throughout the project.
