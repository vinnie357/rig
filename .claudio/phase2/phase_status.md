- **Week 7 End**: Connection resilience and offline operation support
- **Week 8 End**: Real-time event processing and comprehensive testing

## Success Criteria Progress
- [ ] Stable WebSocket connections maintained across network interruptions
- [ ] Phoenix channel protocol fully functional with Max platform
- [ ] Automatic reconnection handles all common failure scenarios
- [ ] Real-time events processed with <100ms latency
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for all communication scenarios

## Resource Allocation
- **Rust Developers**: 2-3 (100% allocation)
- **QA Engineer**: 1 (25% Phase 2, 50% Task 2.4)
- **Total Effort**: 8.5 person-weeks

## Performance Targets
- **Connection Latency**: <100ms event processing
- **Throughput**: >1000 events/second sustained
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with automatic recovery
- **Connection Time**: <500ms WebSocket establishment

## Risk Assessment
**Current Risk Level**: Medium (complex protocol implementation)

**High-Risk Areas**:
- Phoenix channel protocol complexity and undocumented behaviors
- WebSocket connection stability across network environments
- Real-time event processing performance under load

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Early prototyping and Max platform team collaboration
- Comprehensive network condition testing
- Performance optimization and load testing

## Issues and Blockers
**Current Issues**: None

**Potential Blockers**:
- Phase 1 completion delays
- Max platform API documentation availability
- Phoenix channel protocol specification accuracy
- Network testing environment complexity

## Dependencies
**From Previous Phase**: 
- Phase 1 (Foundation) must be complete
- Authentication system functional
- CLI framework and configuration system ready
- Testing infrastructure established

**For Next Phase**: 
- Stable real-time communication infrastructure
- Event processing system for resource management
- Performance-optimized communication layer
- Comprehensive testing framework

## Technical Architecture

### Communication Stack
- **WebSocket Layer**: tokio-tungstenite with connection management
- **Protocol Layer**: Phoenix channel message protocol
- **Resilience Layer**: Reconnection, health monitoring, offline support
- **Event Layer**: Real-time event processing and subscription management

### Integration Points
- **Authentication**: Channel authentication using Phase 1 auth system
- **Configuration**: Communication settings via configuration system
- **Testing**: Extended testing framework for real-time protocols
- **CLI**: Real-time status updates and user feedback

## Quality Gates
- [ ] Protocol compliance with Phoenix framework reference
- [ ] Network resilience testing under adverse conditions
- [ ] Performance benchmarking meets latency requirements
- [ ] Security validation for communication protocols
- [ ] Integration testing with Max platform successful

## Communication
- **Daily Standups**: Technical progress and protocol challenges
- **Weekly Reviews**: Max platform integration and performance validation
- **Phase Transition Review**: End of Week 8
- **Stakeholder Updates**: Weekly progress with performance metrics

## Next Steps
1. Await Phase 1 completion and validation
2. Begin Task 2.1: WebSocket Foundation implementation
3. Establish Max platform integration testing environment
4. Schedule protocol compliance validation sessions

## Notes
This phase implements the critical real-time communication infrastructure that enables all resource management and operational features. The Phoenix channel protocol implementation is particularly complex and may require close collaboration with the Max platform team.

Key focus areas:
- **Protocol Compliance**: Ensure Phoenix channel implementation matches specification exactly
- **Performance Optimization**: Meet latency requirements from initial implementation
- **Network Resilience**: Handle all common network failure scenarios gracefully
- **Testing Comprehensiveness**: Validate all protocol scenarios and edge cases

Success in this phase is critical for the user experience of all subsequent features, as real-time communication underpins resource management, deployment, and operational commands.
