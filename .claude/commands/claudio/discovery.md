Analyze a project to identify tools, requirements, and suggest relevant MCPs through discovery analysis.

**CRITICAL: NEVER fabricate project details or capabilities. Only report findings from actual file and code examination.**

Use the discovery-agent subagent to perform project analysis including technology stack identification, architecture assessment, and MCP recommendations based on actual project files.
