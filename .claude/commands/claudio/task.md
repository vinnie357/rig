Create task lists and specialized agent contexts for project implementation phases based on actual plan analysis.

**CRITICAL: NEVER fabricate task completion status or implementation timelines. Only mark tasks complete when acceptance criteria are met and tests pass.**

Use the task-agent subagent to perform parallel analysis across phase breakdown, context creation, and structure building.
