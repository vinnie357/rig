Create detailed implementation plans with time estimates, phases, dependencies, and resource allocation through parallel planning analysis.

**Plan Types:**
- `feature`: Single feature implementation plan
- `project`: Complete project implementation plan
- `migration`: System/data migration plan
- `refactor`: Code refactoring and improvement plan
- `integration`: System integration implementation plan

Use the plan-agent subagent to create detailed implementation plans with phases, timelines, resource requirements, and risk mitigation strategies.
