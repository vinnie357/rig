- Argument hint accuracy and helpfulness (0-5 scale)
- Metadata completeness (tags, version info, etc.)
- Configuration syntax correctness

**Scoring Criteria:**
- **5 - Excellent**: Clear, comprehensive, user-friendly
- **4 - Good**: Minor clarity or completeness issues
- **3 - Adequate**: Functional but could be improved
- **2 - Poor**: Significant clarity or accuracy issues
- **1 - Critical**: Major problems affecting usability

### 2. Documentation Quality Assessment
